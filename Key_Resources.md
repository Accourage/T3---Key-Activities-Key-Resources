# Key Resources

## Physical, Intellectual, Human, Financial
The physical assets that our business uses are primarily the servers keeping our business active. These servers are rented from Amazon Web Services. Another physical asset that our business has is the main office space where the company is ran from.
Our main intellectual resource is our brand. The name and logo are valuable to our business. As we grow, we will capture data from customers and begin to build a database of information. This will also be one of our intellectual resources. Our intellectual resources will be owned and aquired by us. Accourage's Key resources also include its online platform, its IT and communications infrastructure, its sales and delivery infrastructure, marketing, as well as its partnerships. 

Partners include:
- Restaurant and Merchant Partners, principally comprising a broad network of participating restaurants and food outlets – including 
  fast food franchises, independent restaurants, and foodservice chains – as well as various non-food retailers, including consumer goods 
  retailers;
- Affiliate and Marketing Partners, comprising a range of website and businesses that assist in marketing the Company’s services, and 
  driving traffic to the Company’s online delivery portal;
- Supplier and Service Partners, comprising suppliers of tools, technologies, and services that are utilised across the Company’s 
  enterprise, as well as companies to which certain functions can be outsourced.

## Technology
The Accourage platform will run on cloud servers rented from Amazon Web Services. Some of the servers contain two instances, one for program logic, and one for request laod balancing performed by HaProxy. Data storage will also take place on the cloud service. MySql will be the main technology used for data storage. The program logic will be written in Java using the Spring framework due to its mature ecosystem. Our software will interface with payment providers using the API exposed by the provider. Business technology will be rented from third party providers, as our main focus is on devceloping and maintaining the marketplace.
