MySql will be the main technology used for data storage. The program logic will be written in Java using the Spring framework due to its mature ecosystem. Our software will interface with payment providers using the API exposed by the provider. Business technology will be rented from third party providers, as our main focus is on devceloping and maintaining the marketplace.
