# Key Resources

## Physical, Intellectual, Human, Financial
The physical assets that our business uses are primarily the servers keeping our business active. These servers are rented from Amazon Web Services. Another physical asset that our business has is the main office space where the company is ran from.
Our main intellectual resource is our brand. The name and logo are valuable to our business. As we grow, we will capture data from customers and begin to build a database of information. This will also be one of our intellectual resources. Our intellectual resources will be owned and aquired by us.

## Technology
The Accourage platform will run on cloud servers rented from Amazon Web Services. Some of the servers contain two instances, one for program logic, and one for request laod balancing performed by HaProxy. Data storage will also take place on the cloud service. MySql will be the main technology used for data storage. The program logic will be written in Java using the Spring framework due to its mature ecosystem. Our software will interface with payment providers using the API exposed by the provider. Business technology will be rented from third party providers, as our main focus is on devceloping and maintaining the marketplace.
